        <h2>WEB</h2>
        <p>GNOME Web, called Epiphany until 2012 and still known 
        by that code name, is a free and open-source web browser 
        based on the GTK port of Apple's WebKit rendering engine, 
        called WebKitGTK. 
        It is developed by the GNOME project for Unix-like systems. 
        It is the default and official web browser of GNOME, 
        and part of the GNOME Core Applications.Despite being a component of GNOME, 
        Web has no dependency on GNOME components, so it can be potentially installed 
        on any system supporting GTK and WebKitGTK.GNOME Web is 
        the default web browser on elementary OS and Bodhi Linux version 5.</p>
